# PRE-IMPL Findings

## Confirmed

1. Kotlin is viable for Jenkins plugin implementation.
2. External direct step invocation is not a stable API model.
3. A run-backed bridge is the safest initial architecture.

## Open Gaps

1. Precise operation schema definitions.
2. Backing job creation and lifecycle strategy.
3. Permission model granularity per operation.
